Reacting to React
Getting Started
Create a new project with Create React App.
Delete the src and public directory and all of its contents.
Create a new public directory and a new index.html file inside of public.
Use the ! emmet shortcut to generate a fresh html document in the index.html file. Place <div id="root"></div> in the <body> of the html document you created. (like we did in earlier videos!)
Create a new src directory and a components directory inside of src.
Create an App.jsx and a index.js file inside of src.
Write the basic "entry point" code for the index.js file, avoid copy/paste so you can practice writing it yourself!
